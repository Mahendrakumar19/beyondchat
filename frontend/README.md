Frontend — README

This is a small React + Vite app that fetches articles from the Laravel API and displays them.

Setup
1) cd frontend
2) npm install
3) Create `.env` or pass `VITE_API_URL` env var to point to backend, default is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
4) npm run dev

The UI shows a left column of articles and the selected article on the right (original and updated content).
